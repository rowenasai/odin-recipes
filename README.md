# odin-recipes

This is my first project on The Odin Project, also,
my first time ever using Git when building something.

That will be the main challenge: learning how to commit,
when to do it and doing it correctly.

Also, even though it is going to be rather simple in its
structure, I will focus on building a good navigation,
and an intuitive experience.

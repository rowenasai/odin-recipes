# odin-recipes

Before starting the project:

This is my first project on The Odin Project, also,
my first time ever using Git when building something.

That will be the main challenge: learning how to commit,
when to do it and doing it correctly.

Also, even though it is going to be rather simple in its
structure, I will focus on building a good navigation,
and an intuitive experience.

After the project:

Commits were the challenge, indeed. I didn't do it until I finished the project.
I hadn't internalized its reiterative importance throughout the process.
If I were to make the project again, I would commit after finishing each page.

Valuable lessons from this project:
-How to commit
-How to add and commit multiple files at once
-Pushing commits to GitHub

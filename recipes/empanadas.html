                <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>Basically, a Venezuelan empanada is made with corn dough, then stuffed with anything you can imagine (chicken,
                        <br>meat, cheeses, Cazón/shark), and then deep-fried.</p>
                    <p>The corn dough has a wonderful texture. It also soaks up less grease than fried empanadas made with flour dough.</p>
                    <p>Of course, when eating empanadas, we cannot forget about another element: THE SAUCE!!</p>
                    <p>The crisp crust and tender inner texture of corn empanadas is the perfect excuse to invite additional condiments.
                    <br><br>Try the traditional Venezuelan avocado sauce: <a href="./guasacaca.html">Guasacaca.</a></p>

                        <li>2 cups water</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

                        <li>1 1/2 cups Harina P.A.N (pre-cooked white maize meal)</li>
                        <li>1/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                        <li>Oil to fry (I use corn oil)</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <h3>Make the filling</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Place the shark steaks, bay leaf, and 1 tablespoon salt in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil
                            <br>over medium heat. Reduce to a simmer, cover and cook until the fish is cooked about 15 minutes.Transfer
                            <br>the fish to a bowl and shred with a fork (be careful to remove the skin and/or bones). Set aside. </li>
                        <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion, bell pepper, sweet peppers, leeks,
                            <br>green onions, and garlic; cook until the onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. Stir in the cumin. Add
                            <br>the shark, mix well, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook over medium-low heat for about 10 minutes.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Make the dough</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Wash your hands. In a medium bowl add water, salt, and sugar. Mix until the salt and sugar are dissolved.</li>
                        <li>Mix Harina P.A.N, flour, and baking powder in a bowl</li>
                        <li>Slowly add dry ingredients to the water and mix/incorporate with your hands, making circular movements and
                        <br>breaking with your finger the lumps that may form. Let rest 5 minutes to thicken. The dough should be firm
                        <br>enough holds its shape without cracking when molded. If it is too soft add a little more of harina P.A.N;
                        <br>if too hard add a little more water.</li>
                    </ol>   

                    <h3>Form the empanadas</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Divide the mixture into 8 equal portions and form into little balls. Flatten each ball between two sheets of
                        <br>plastic until it is approximately 8 inches (see notes). Put some of the cazon filling in the center of the
                        <br>empanada, about 1-2 tablespoons. Using the plastic sheet, carefully fold over the dough into a semicircle.
                        <br>Trim into a half-moon shape with a knife or press down with the round edge of a bowl.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Fry the empanadas</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Heat enough oil in a skillet until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350º F. Fry the empanadas in batches
                        <br>until golden, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet; keep warm in the oven
                        <br>at 300º F.</li>
                        <li>Serve hot.</li>
